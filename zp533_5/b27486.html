While other major world powers pursued and embraced different weapons and technologies in order to create different means of waging war the US spent decades training developing and employing amphibious warfare to pursue its national interests.<br> The Emergence of American Amphibious Warfare 1898-1945 examines how the United States became a superpower through amphibious operations in order to project military power. While other major world powers pursued and embraced different weapons and technologies in order to create different means of waging war the United States was one of the few countries that spent decades training developing and employing amphibious warfare to pursue its national interests. <br>Commonly seen as dangerous and costly amphibious warfare was carefully modernized refined and promoted within American political and military circles for years by a small motley group of military mavericks intellectuals innovators and crackpots. <br>This generational cast of underdogs and unlikely heroes were able to do the impossible by predicting and convincing America"s leadership how the United States should fight the Second World War. From the United States" first tentative steps in landing troops from the sea in Cuba during the Spanish-American War to the iconic flag raising of U.S. Marines in Iwo Jima during the Second World War Amphibious Warfare and U.S. Geopolitical Strategy 1898-1945 is a historical journey of the United States" rise to greatness. <br>Through amphibious warfare the United States underwent an extraordinary transformation in such a short period from backwater republic to global superpower.<br>The Emergence of American Amphibious Warfare 1898-1945<br> is an analytical study that focuses on the people  events technologies and conflicts that shaped and modernized amphibious warfare. <br>In addition we also see how the United States patiently pursued a deliberate and systematic approach in adopting a form of warfare that many rival powers saw as antiquated and impractical in an increasingly technological and industrialized world. As a result the United States" unlikely and meteoric rise in the first half of the 20th century not only shocked the world but dramatically transformed the balance of power in the international system. <br>In conclusion <br>The Emergence of American Amphibious Warfare 1898-1945<br> reveals that despite new ways for states to project military power today as seen with airpower nuclear weapons cyber warfare and special operators amphibious warfare has proven to be the most important in transforming the United States and the world. In understanding how amphibious warfare allowed the United States to achieve geopolitical supremacy competitor states are now looking at America"s amphibious past as a potential option to challenge the United States" global leadership and expand its power and influence in the world.<br> Reviews&lt; br&gt;David Nasca"s recent book <br>The Emergence of American Amphibious Warfare 1898-1945<br> brilliantly describes the process whereby American amphibious warfare grew from ad hoc landing operations by a ship"s company to a decisive factor in the outcome of major wars as exemplified by World War II and beyond-- highly recommended for all students of military arts and sciences." <br>--Gary J. Ohls author of <br>American Amphibious Warfare: The Roots of Tradition to 1865 <br>; professor U.S. Naval War College (Ret.)<br> "Following the 1915 British debacle at Gallipoli most military strategists were convinced that amphibious warfare was going nowhere fast. At long last historian David S. Nasca successfully chronicles why America decided to stick with the concept and eventually was able to perfect it during World War II. Nasca is quick to point out the role that the development of specialized amphibious warfare technology - something the British clearly lacked at Gallipoli - played in the WWII success of the United States in both the European and Pacific theaters. A great lesson for modern-day strategists to remember." <br>--Charles P. Neimeyer Ph.D. Director USMC History Division (Ret.)<br> "Mr. Nasca"s book <br>The Emergence of American Amphibious Warfare 1898-1945<br> not only explains how the United States became a superpower in amphibious warfare - but also why amphibious warfare will be so vitally important in the 21st Century. Global major power competition will undoubtedly continue to shape the contours of both amphibious warfare and geopolitics." <br>--Maj. Gen. Carl Jensen U.S. Marine Corps (Ret.)<br> About the Author<br>David Stephen Nasca <br> graduated cum laude from Longwood University in 2000. He holds graduate degrees in international relations diplomacy history military studies and national security from several universities as well as a Ph.D. He proudly followed in.
